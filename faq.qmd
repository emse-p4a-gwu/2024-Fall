## Where can I see my grades?

[box.com](https://box.com/)

I do **not** use Blackboard for showing your grades, so please ignore anything you see there. Instead, I create a unique folder for each of you on box.com. The folder will be named `netID-p4a`. For example, my netID is `jph`, so my folder would be `jph-p4a`. 

If you log into box.com using your GW email, you should be able to find this folder. All of your graded feedback will be in that folder. You will see a pdf of feedback for each assignment as well as two CSV files: one that displays your grade for each assignment, and another that shows your current total grade in the class.

## When can I expect to see a grade for my assignment?

Since homeworks are due the night before class, I usually can't grade them all by the start of class. Some weeks it can take me up to a whole week to grade something, so at most you can expect to see a grade **one week after submitting it**.

## How do I make a zip file for my homework?

## I got this error message

> `could not find function "functionName"`

- Did you load the package that contains `functionName`?
- Did you spell `functionName` correctly?
